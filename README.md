# **Scope Report: Machine Learning Classification of Stars, Quasars, and Galaxies Using SDSS Data**

## **1. Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies stars, quasars, and galaxies using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By leveraging linear regression algorithms and data visualization techniques, we seek to identify key distinguishing features of these celestial objects, contributing to astrophysical research and enhancing automated classification methods.

## **2. Research Objectives**
- Develop a machine learning model for classifying celestial objects.
- Identify the most significant photometric and spectroscopic features for classification.

  - Spectral features, including emission line characteristics
  - Redshift (z), providing distance measurements
  - Flux measurements across various wavelengths
  - Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec) for spatial distribution analysis

## **4. Methodology**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and handling of missing values.
